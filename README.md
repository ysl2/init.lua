> TLDR:
>
> 1. Single main file: There is only one main file `./lua/ysl/init.lua` which contains common configuration and lots of common plugins.
> 2. All things you need: language server & auto completion & diagnostics, file tree, motion, bookmark, register, edit history, buffer & window control, terminal, git, session save & auto restore like vscode, colors & highlight & outlooks, motions, fuzzy find & global replace, remote ssh, markdown image paste & markdown preview
> 3. Original keymap: I don't like to define many custom keymaps so I try my best to keep native keymaps and only map some functions or applications.
> 4. Very fast: All plugins are lazyloaded so you can gain best performance of this configuration.
> 5. Clean: The files are clean and well structured so that you can easily understand and modify them to fit your needs.
> 6. Choose your own: I provide a local config file `./lua/ysl/secret.lua` so that you can cover some default settings like: which colorscheme, which lsp, which file to require, add your own plugin list. For example, You can select your lsp flavor from `./lua/ysl/lsp/nvim_lsp.lua` or `./lua/ysl/lsp/coc.lua`, default is `nvim_lsp`, choose the one you like from these two files, write it into `./lua/ysl/secret.lua`.
> 7. Run any command: Directly into nvim. For example, you can run `htop` in nvim with a floating window.
> 8. Intregration with others: VSCode's neovim extension support, Chrome support.
